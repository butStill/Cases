## Ratchet and Clank
- [Sound and music needs to match pace and tone of level - don't rush them if you don't need to, can't tell sidequest from mainquest - creates feeling of adventure, discovery, and mirrors feeling that protagonist is supposed to have, unique personalities of one-off characters that mirror real interaction (similar to wow), have their own motives and agendas - protagonist not center of the universe, and actually react to the ridiculous stuff that happens in the world - creates stories and adds flavor, characters follow theme of greed, banter between main characters + clear character arcs that progress along with story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnG2gOKV9dw)


## Fallout

- Splash screens, box, manual, interface, website should all be part of the universe - no element added that doesn't match (the perk avatar guy)
- Deeply embeded easter eggs and references - encourage inside jokes
- Test it with all the different gameplay styles - use the devs and indirectly encourage them to make stuff they enjoy
- Play off your limitations --> fallout hex system, building art style around it
