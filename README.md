# Cases and Stuff


## Ratchet and Clank
- [Sound and music needs to match pace and tone of level - don't rush them if you don't need to, can't tell sidequest from mainquest - creates feeling of adventure, discovery, and mirrors feeling that protagonist is supposed to have, unique personalities of one-off characters that mirror real interaction (similar to wow), have their own motives and agendas - protagonist not center of the universe, and actually react to the ridiculous stuff that happens in the world - creates stories and adds flavor, characters follow theme of greed, banter between main characters + clear character arcs that progress along with story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnG2gOKV9dw)


## Fallout

- Splash screens, box, manual, interface, website should all be part of the universe - no element added that doesn't match (the perk avatar guy)
- Deeply embeded easter eggs and references - encourage inside jokes (lessens grind for devs + rewards exploration, adds to stupid atmosphere)
- Test it with all the different gameplay styles - use the devs and indirectly encourage them to make stuff they enjoy
- Play off your limitations --> fallout hex system, building art style around it

## Loading Screens 

- https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/05/interactive-loading-screens/ --> immersion-breaking, flow-breaking, design to maximize flow or to reduce number of load screens --> make loading part of gameplay by having practice arena 

- resident evil --> creating tension through loading screens, door opening animationhttps://80.lv/articles/game-details-turning-ordinary-to-extraordinary/

- game tips, e.g. ds but breaks game flow --> maybe try procedurally generated animations, random minigames, practice mode

## The Last Guardian

- using symbolism in puzzles --> teaching game mechanics --> easily memorable and prevent breakdown of immersion with random puzzles

## Alto's Odyssey

- UI --> how ambient sound + weather continue in the background to make it feel like you're still part of the game, how it slides from menu to menu, it's simplicity + the nice sounds for entering and exiting menus

- gameplay --> easy to start playing, the animation of the guy bending his knees as he goes up slopes (capturing the feeling of snowboarding), the ambience and the sound made by the board in the sand 

- main menu in general --> doesnt seem like an entirely different element to the game, immersive --> the way the menu first pops up reflects atmosphere/ambience of the game itself --> dont enter the game and then see some random menu with no relevance to the game
